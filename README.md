# Turtle Leaf Pattern

This is a simple Python program that uses the **Turtle Graphics** library to draw a **leaf-like circular pattern**. Each leaf is created using arcs, and the turtle rotates after each one to form a complete shape.

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `turtle` (included with Python)

---

## How It Works

1. The program initializes the Turtle environment:

   * Full-screen window
   * Black background
   * White drawing color
   * Moderate pen thickness for smooth lines

2. It defines a single function:

   * `leaf()`: Draws a leaf shape by combining two circular arcs connected by a turn.

3. The main loop:

   * Calls `leaf()` multiple times (9 by default)
   * Rotates slightly between each iteration to create a radial pattern

---

## Running the Program

Run the script in a Python environment that supports Turtle graphics (such as the standard **Python IDLE**):

```bash
python main.py
```

Click anywhere on the window to close it when the drawing is finished.

---

## Customization

* **Change the number of leaves**:

  ```python
  for i in range(12):
      leaf()
  ```

* **Adjust the angle between leaves** inside the `leaf()` function:

  ```python
  t.left(60)
  ```

* **Modify the color or background**:

  ```python
  t.color("green")
  screen.bgcolor("lightblue")
  ```

* **Change leaf curvature** by adjusting the circle radius or arc extent:

  ```python
  t.circle(80, 120)
  ```
